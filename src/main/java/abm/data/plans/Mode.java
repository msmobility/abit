    // behind it, so the interface cannot access to Mode.values() (that someone could call by mistake now) for looping
    // across all modes, which would end up, e.g. looking for coefficients for Mode.UNKNOWN or final choices of it.
    // However, this may not be obvious because getModes() is here a static method but with the interface it
    // would be non-static, so an instance of the used Mode (here Mode as interface) shoudl exist e.g. in the dataset.
